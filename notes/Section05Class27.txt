Whew! We just learned about arrow functions and helper methods, and it seems like a nice break from learning could help (totally optional of course).

Let’s take a moment though, to overview the important topics we discussed in this section.

Arrow functions work like normal method expressions in JavaScript, but with a shorter syntax. They also have the added benefit of being anonymous. In addition, unlike normal JavaScript function, they do not bind the this object to their function scope.
The map helper method in es6 allows us to create arrays by calling a function on each element of an initial array.
