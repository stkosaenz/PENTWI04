Coding Break: Classes

You probably have the hang of this by this point and know exactly how you want to respond.However, we have arrived at another optional coding break.Up to you to just skip it or take the chance to briefly review what we just learned!

ES6 brought in a concept widely recognized in the computer science field: object - oriented programming.Let’s review what that means in terms of classes, inheritance, and more.

    Object - oriented programming models “objects” to real world objects, assigning state and relevant methods to those “objects.”

Encapsulation, keeps data safe from use outside of classes.

Inheritance occurs when a class extends another class, receiving all the same behavior from that base class.

A class in es6 holds pertinent data and methods and also allows for simple inheritance.

Extends is an es6 keyword that signals a class inheriting data from a base class

    Classes in es6 welcome a whole new realm of possible programming in es6.Also, JavaScript classes compared to other languages feature a much more understandable syntax.Not to mention that the actual inheritance occurs much more smoothly when compared to the object - oriented programming models featured elsewhere.

Stay classy coders.
